  <h3>OUR MISSION</h3>
  <p>To offer you the most beautiful floral arrangements grown in proximity and respecting the cycles of nature.
    The cut flower market is not always without consequences for our planet.
That's why at Iris we want to open a new path: to offer you fresh, local flowers, full of color, prepared with great care and attention, while limiting our environmental impact as much as possible. In our online florist we are committed to creating a new floral culture and concept.
